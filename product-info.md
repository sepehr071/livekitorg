It is built for industries like transport & logistics, warehouse management, and delivery where the workers are expected to change locations often. While you're busy with your tasks perhaps walking around, the reliable Bluetooth connection sends captured data to other smart devices in real-time.### Connecting seamlessly to the variety of popular platformsPM3 is compatible with products run by Android as well as Windows operating systems, making it easier to introduce a new data capture solution into the existing environment with low extra cost. PM3 lowers the barrier to digitalizing any workflow of warehouse management, inventory-taking, or delivery.### A Powerful scan performance in disguise of the small form factorPM3 offers three types of scan engines including two 1D and one 1D/2D imager. You might opt for a 1D scan engine if your work environment only uses 1D barcodes. But if your business can benefit from applying QR codes or needs more scanning power and speed in general, a 1D/2D engine can be a better fit which also supports omnidirectional scanning as an added benefit. While you use the scanner or change settings the bright OLED display shows you what's going on.### A low-maintenance device withstanding a harsh environmentPM3 withstands multiple drops from 1.5m (5ft) to the concrete floor at room temperature (MIL-STD 810G) and has an IP54 water/dust resistance rating. The physical scan button has gone through 1,000,000 durability test cycles: The PM3 is a device built to last with minimum needs for repair even in a harsh working environment.### Industries- Transport & Logistics- Delivery- Warehouse Management- Field Services- Hospitality### Accessories| Standard | Optional || AC/DC Power Adaptor USB Type-C Cable | Finger Glove Lanyard Silicone Case |### Features (represented by icons)- ARM® 120MHz- 128KB/1MB RAM/ROM- Works with Android- Works with Windows- Bluetooth Class II Ver 4.2- 900mAh battery- Daylight readable- Imager- IP54 water/dust resistance- 1.5m (5ft) drop resistance---# POINT MOBILE DATA SHEETPM3-DS11-EN## PM3### PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS| **Main-Processor** | 32-bit ARM® Cortex®–M4 RISC processor 120MHz || **Firmware** | Proprietary firmware Upgrade via USB English, Korean, Chinese support Software development tool support || **Supported Host OS** | Android, Windows || **Memory and Storage** | RAM: 128KB ROM (Flash): 1MB (PGM), 4MB storage |### PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS| **Dimensions** | 78.5mm L x 39.0mm W x 19.4mm D 3.1in L x 1.5in W x 1.1in D || **Weight** | 65g / 2.3oz || **Integrated Battery** | 3.7V, 900mAh Li-ion || **Display** | 64 x 128 pixels 1.0in OLED (Monochrome) || **Keys** | 1 Scan button, 2 Menu button || **Standard Communications** | Full Speed USB 2.0 (12Mbps) || **Notification** | LED: 2 Dual Color LEDs, 1 Single Color LED Buzzer: 80dB (from 10cm/3.9in) Vibration: Support |### BLUETOOTH| **Version** | Bluetooth Class II, Ver. 4.2 || **Supported Modes** | Serial Port Profile (SPP), Human Interface Device Profile (HID), Service Discovery Application Profile (SDAP) |### DATA CAPTURE| **Integrated Scan Engines** | 1D laser: SE965 1D CCD: SE655 1D/2D: SE4710 |### USER ENVIRONMENT| **Operating Temperature** | -10°C to 50°C / 14°F to 122°F || **Drop** | Multiple 1.5m/5ft drops to concrete at operating temperature range (MIL-STD 810G) || **Rain/dust proof (Sealing)** | IP54 || **Electrostatic Discharge** | ±15 kV air discharge ±8 k V direct discharge |### REGULATORY APPROVALS AND COMPLIANCESafety: IEC 62368-1, IEC 60825-1, IEC 62471Radio: CE, KCC MarksEnvironmental: RoHS & WEEE compliant### WARRANTYSubject to the Terms and Conditions, PM3 carries 1 (one) year-warranty period from the date of purchase against the defective materials and manufacturing defects.

PM66 has proven its power and versatility around many applications, and we now upgraded the internals and improved performance, while leaving the outside intact.### Keeping the good thingsIn many industrial applications, users prefer physical keys instead of a touch-based virtual keypad on screen when they need an absolutely accurate data input. The full numeric keypad comes in even more handy when working with gloves or outside in bad weather. Each key on PM67 is wide and big enough for solid and fast typing. LED back-lit keypad makes working easy even in dimly lit areas. As well as the keypad, the dimension and the shape of the device remains the same as its predecessor, making PM67 backward compatible with nearly all accessories of PM66 and keeping the cost per device on a low.| PM66 | || • Android 6 • 1.2GHz Quad-core • 2GB/16GB Memory • Micro USB Type B • Standard SIM | || PM67 | || • Android 11 • 2.0GHz Octa-core • 3GB/32GB Memory • USB Type C • Micro SIM | |### More power for advanced solutionsDespite the same external design, almost all performance aspects have gone through an upgrade. PM67 runs Android 11 OS, offering better security and more convenient yet intuitive interface. 2.0GHz Qualcomm Octa-core processor (1.8GHz optional) and 3GB RAM run even power-intensive business solutions smoothly. Bluetooth 5.1 with BLE support helps PM67 connect to multiple devices instantly and reliably, and Wi-Fi data transfer is about three times faster than PM66 (maximum speed comparison).

With integrated LTE and Wi-Fi technology, PM30hc stays connected when you need it. Update patient records, track lab results, and discuss the next steps of treatment with your staff.Breaks in connection can prove hugely costly and cause serious consequences. To avoid disruptions, PM30hc's Qualcomm® chipset contains a powerful Wi-Fi module, supporting both 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies. Additionally, thanks to Wi-Fi roaming, you can move freely within your premises, while PM30hc automatically connects to the nearest access point with the strongest signal. It prevents users from having to re-log back into a network with the same SSID when it associates with a new access point. It is possible to specifically set the values for roaming aggressiveness based on the network environment where PM30hc is being used.A dedicated Push-to-talk (PTT) button lets you reach out to a single person or even a group of people at an instant. It works similar to a walkie-talkie: One person transmits, the others receive. This adds a significant advantage when handling time-critical information.[Wi-Fi ALLIANCE logo]---# 02722,000 infections are contracted every year in US hospitals - good hygiene helps against the spread of germs and reduces the risk of infections.Mobile computers used in the medical field need to be protected against sanitizers. PM30hc's housing is made of a special material and is resistant to alcohol & ethanol.According to CDC, healthcare providers clean their hands as many as 100 times during a 12-hour shift. Aiming to reduce the risk of infections for both patients and staff, good hand hygiene is extremely important. But also equipment and electronic devices used in the hospital environment are covered in germs which can cause serious infections. Cleaning those devices often result in deterioration, since materials are not designed to be exposed to the heavy usage of sanitizers. That's why healthcare facilities trust PM30hc: Its corrosion resistant housing is resistant to various types of disinfectant, including chlorine or 70% alcohol solutions.¹According to CDC's Clean Hands Count Campaign---# 03## EXCEPTIONAL COMPUTING POWERDespite its small form factor, PM30hc comes with the latest Android™ 10 version, and the possibility to upgrade to newer versions. An incredibly fast clock speed of 2.2GHz and 4GB RAM / 64GB ROM run all of your apps seamlessly. The PTT button on the side of the device lets you communicate with your staff instantly. Of course, PM30hc can also be used for phone calls via the high-speed 4G LTE modem. Storage is extendable with SD card.## WIRELESS CHARGINGPM30hc can be charged wirelessly with compatible chargers (sold separately). When charging by USB-C, Qualcomm® Quick Charge 3.0™ boosts PM30hc's battery level to over 50% in less than an hour.![Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 logo]## OPTICAL FINGERPRINT READER AND POGO PINWhen confidential patient data and lab results have to be protected, PM30hc's integrated optical fingerprint reader on the back of the housing adds a layer of security via user identification. Below the fingerprint reader is a pogo pin connector for additional accessory, such as a UHF reader extension or a gun handle.---# INTEGRATED BARCODE SCANNERUtilizing barcode technology in the health care industry brings many advantages: Ensuring patient safety, reduced risk of false medication, improved efficiency for inventory tasks, and many more - from admission to discharge of a patient.On a daily basis, healthcare facilities deal with patient admission, tracking assets and inventory, and validating information. In an environment where every second matters, practitioners rely on the right data at the right time. Using barcode technology helps to organize all processes around the patient: Once admitted, the patient receives a wristband with a barcode, containing all relevant information for doctors and nurses. That barcode is linked to the patient's Electronic Health Record, or EHR, which is constantly updated when a treatment is ordered or medication is changed.## 04Typically, barcode-enabled devices come in a much larger form factor when integrated into a mobile computer. If a smaller, more compact device is required, often times a separate barcode scanner will be used in addition to a smartphone. PM30hc combines both worlds: It is a compact, light weight rugged mobile computer (165g, 5.8oz) with an integrated super slim 2D barcode imager engine from Honeywell.| N6X03 | PM30hc's scan engine has 64% less volume than the next smaller engine, and captures data at a high performance.

Improper battery use may result in a fire, explosion, or other critical hazards.### Battery Safety Guidelines- Use only Point Mobile approved batteries and charging accessories. Other batteries and chargers may damage the device or result in a fire, leakage, or other hazards.- Do not expose the battery to excessive heat or cold.- Do not use or store the battery in or near areas that might get very hot, such as in a parked vehicle, near a heat duct or close to other heat sources.- Do not allow objects that may cause a short circuit, such as metal objects, corrosive substances, or liquids like water, to contact the battery.- Do not disassemble, crush, bend, shred, press, or other actions that may damage or deform the battery.- Do not use or replace the battery on the go or from a high location. Dropping may result in an explosion or fire.- Do not put any labels, stickers, tags, etc. on the device or battery. Performance of the device or battery, such as sealing, drop, or tumble, could be affected.- Close supervision is necessary when used near children to avoid the risk of injury.- If battery leakage is observed, avoid any contact with the skin or eyes and properly dispose of the battery. If contact has been made, wash the affected area with water for 15 minutes and seek medical advice.- If you notice any type of damage to the battery, such as swelling, dents, and leaks, stop using it immediately and contact Point Mobile.### Battery Charging Guidelines- Charge the battery in a clean, cool, dry, and ventilated environment.- Separate the charger from the battery as soon as possible when the battery is fully charged.- Battery performance can degrade due to the stress of daily charging and discharging. Batteries typically need to be replaced after 300 to 500 charging cycles (full charge-discharge cycles) or when the battery capacity has been reduced to 70 ~ 80% of its original capacity. The actual number of charging cycles varies based on usage patterns, temperature, age, and other factors.98© 2024 Point Mobile Co., Ltd. All rights reserved# Payment## Battery Storage / Disposal Guidelines- Store the batteries in a clean, dry and ventilated environment within ambient temperature ranges of 20±5℃.- For safety regulations, batteries are charged to below 20~30% of full capacity during production.- When not using batteries for a long period, charge the battery for 30 minutes to 1 hour at least once every 6 months to prevent full discharge and keep the performance.- Batteries should be stored separately when storing for long periods. Disconnect from any device, charger, or cradle.- Dispose of used batteries promptly according to local disposal regulations.- Do not dispose of the battery in fire. It may cause explosion.**Notice:** The battery is consumable. Point Mobile provides a warranty for the battery for 12 months after purchase. If you suspect the battery swelling, change the battery immediately and contact Point Mobile.99© 2024 Point Mobile Co., Ltd.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Honeywell just announced Mobility Edge. They are seven years and $300m in investment behind us — that's light years in terms of technology lifecycles. It will take them years to catch up to where Mobility DNA is today — in the meantime, we'll continue to add new capabilities and tools. Light in features. The CT60 lacks many of the key device features including: no front facing camera; a smaller display; less standard memory; smaller standard battery (and battery is harder to swap); heavier and bulkier. No platform approach. Honeywell is developing both Mobility Edge and their new CT40/CT60 EDA products in piecemeal fashion. CT50 customers cannot easily migrate to the CT60.

LifeGuard for AndroidRecently Zebra introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).LG is available on the [insert product family] and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:1) **Extended Security Service Life** - Security updates under LG is based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) **Timely, Periodic Security Updates** – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) **Security Support Through OS transitions** - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here.---# 7.

LifeGuard for AndroidRecently Zebra introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).---LG is available on the TC22 and TC27 for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:1) **Extended Security Service Life** - Security updates under LG is based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) **Timely, Periodic Security Updates** – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) **Security Support Through OS transitions** - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here.## 7.

A new 2.2GHz Octa-core processor powers the Android 11 operating system that the PM90 runs on with 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM memory as a standard option. The bright 5" display was completely redesigned and shows crystal clear information from any angle. All of the hardware buttons (except the power key) can be individually programmed with the pre-installed EmKit. We gave it a new Honeywell Slim Imager Engine for convenient, reliable and fast barcode scanning. And we gave it a bigger battery with 2,900mAh capacity as standard, with an optional extended version with 5,800mAh. We just gave it so much more, while keeping the timeless design with only a little retouch overall. The housing is now ink black which gives it a smooth and stylish finish.### Seven years support: The new PULS programWe extended the lifetime of the PM90 to up to seven years after the market launch. During that period, we will continuously supply security patches, updates and even upgrades to newer Android versions. Installing updates via the pre-installed FOTA (Firmware over the Air) application is fast and convenient as users can perform the update on their own without having to collect all devices from the field. There is no downtime and all data remains safe on the device while only those parts that require fixing will be updated.### Industries- Retail- Field Services- Public Sector- Transport & Logistics- Hospitality### Accessories| Standard | Optional || AC/DC Power Adaptor Country Plug USB Type-C Cable Standard Battery Wrist Lanyard LCD Protection Film | Extended Battery Single Slot Cradle (opt.

SE4710 is also a 1D/2D imager and is the most powerful among the three of them in terms of both speed and distance. Depending on the work settings and the primary data each business needs, two different keypads are provided as options: Numeric and Alphanumeric. LTE is also optional for businesses who are concerned with the high cost of installing many wireless access points.### Well-rounded performance and durabilityThe 2.0GHz octa-core processor runs the Android 11 (upgradable) operating system smoothly, supporting any modern and newer solutions for Android. The PM351 is one of the few enterprise devices using technologies deployed in 802.11ax-ready, or Wi-Fi 6 ready, enabling fast and secure data transfer. 4,800mAh battery enables the device to go all day without charging. With the operating temperature ranging from -20°C to 60°C*, IP65 water/dust resistance, and 1.5m (5ft) drops to concrete floor durability, PM351 is ready for any harsh industrial settings.*-20°C to 60°C with 1D scan engine and -20°C to 50°C with 2D scan engines| Corporate Headquarters | China Headquarters | Europe Headquarters | NA Headquarters || Point Mobile Co., Ltd. | Point Mobile China | Point Mobile Europe GmbH | Point Mobile Americas LLC || pm\_sales1\@pointmobile.com | info\@pointmobile.com.cn | Info.pmeg\@pointmobile.com | info\@pointmobileamericas.com || +82 2 3397 7870 | +86 755 8869 1169 | +49 211 1588 5913 | +1 425 780 4452 |Google, Android, Google Play and other marks are trademarks of Google LLC.Copyright © 2006-2023 Point Mobile Co., Ltd.

LifeGuard for AndroidZebra has introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG), representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).LG is available on the TC15 and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. It includes the following support:1) Extended Security Service Life - Security updates under LG are based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For the Zebra TC15 product, that is 4 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in use for a longer period of time.2) Timely, Periodic Security Updates – customers receive security updates as frequently as quarterly. Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) Security Support Through OS Transitions - when Zebra releases a new Android OS quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click hereZebra Confidential.

IntroductionIntroducing the new TC53 (WLAN) and TC58 (WWAN/Cellular) mobile computers, the new generation of our best-selling enterprise mobile computer. The newest device in the TC5 lineup balances enhanced durability with ergonomics and intuitive design for maximum usability and productivity in retail, manufacturing, field service and logistics verticals. Launching with Android 11 and designed exclusively for front-line workers, TC53/TC58 features 5G, CBRS (US only) and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, the latest Qualcomm octa-core 2.7 GHz processor to facilitate instant updates and access to corporate data for more accurate inventory visibility and on-time delivery status. TC53/TC58 also incorporates enterprise-grade Wi-Fi functionality for optimized indoor connectivity performance in large buildings including faster roaming between access points and network fault recovery to eliminate dropped connections and app interrupts and to maximize voice-over-IP (VOIP) call quality.TC53/TC58 enhances both retail and field-based workflows with a large bright 6" FHD+ Gorilla Glass display which can be used when wet or with bare or gloved hands or with a conductive stylus. An integrated SE55 Advanced Range Scan Engine with IntelliFocus™ technology allows workers to scan items in hand or across the room – capturing top-shelf barcodes without a ladder and low barcodes without bending down. An improved 16 MP rear camera with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) enables better low light and high dynamic range performance, and a new, integrated time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensor empowers high accuracy parcel dimensioning. ARCore certification enables accurate AR assisted applications such as BOPIS picking, worker training and material location tracking.A comprehensive battery lineup lets you choose the battery capacity and features you need: Standard capacity, Extended capacity giving the worker 1.5x times the power, BLE battery with the ability to find and track misplaced devices via combination of on-device technology and the Zebra Device Tracker cloud application or certified 3rd party tracking applications to locate devices up to two weeks later even when the main battery is depleted, and a Wireless charge battery (TC58 only) providing options for wireless charging for frictionless in-vehicle charging. Fast charging, warm swap battery mode (standard models) and true hot swap battery mode (premium models) ensure uninterrupted data and voice connectively when replacing the battery. TC53/TC58 also supports Workstation---Connect which provides a true multi-tasking desktop experience and Mobility DNA Wireless Edge Insights for visibility into Wi-Fi network health through existing Network Analytics dashboards from Cisco, Mist, Aruba and Extreme Networks. TC53/TC58 is powered by Zebra's Mobility DNA, the industry's most comprehensive suite of Productivity, Management and Development tools that enable enterprises, partners, and developers to customize and manage the TC53/TC58 experience for their unique workflows.![Two views of a rugged smartphone device, one showing the front with a large touchscreen displaying "10:00", and the other showing the back with camera and scanning capabilities.]The TC53/TC58 will set the standard for enterprise mobile computers, offering:- Latest Qualcomm 6490 octa-core CPU, with a performance core running at 2.7 GHz- 5G, CBRS (US Only), Wi-Fi 6E certified- 6-inch Full HD+ display- SE55 Advanced Range Scan Engine with IntelliFocus™ technology or SE4720 1D/2D Scan Engine- Memory options (RAM and Flash): 4GB or 8GB RAM, 64GB or 128GB Flash- 16MP Color Rear Camera with flash, 8MP front camera leveraging Zebra's new and improved camera app delivering functionality and improved user experience; Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) available in premium SKUs- Time of Flight (ToF) depth sensor available in premium and certified premium SKUs- Android 11, includes long term support for future releases- ARCore certification (all SKUs)- Removable lithium-ion battery options available: 4400 mAh standard battery, 6600 mAh Extended Range, 4400 mAh BLE Beacon battery- TC58 Premium SKUs support wireless charging through a 4400 mAh Wireless Charge battery and Wireless Charge vehicle cradle.- Device Tracker support with BLE beacon batteryZebra Confidential.

LifeGuard for AndroidRecently Zebra introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).LG is available on the TC53/TC58 and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:1) **Extended Security Service Life** - Security updates under LG are based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) **Timely, Periodic Security Updates** – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) **Security Support Through OS transitions** - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here.## 7.

LifeGuard for AndroidZebra has introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG), representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).LG is available on the TC15 and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. It includes the following support:1) Extended Security Service Life - Security updates under LG are based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For the Zebra TC15 product, that is 4 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in use for a longer period of time.2) Timely, Periodic Security Updates – customers receive security updates as frequently as quarterly. Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) Security Support Through OS Transitions - when Zebra releases a new Android OS quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click hereZebra Confidential.

LifeGuard for AndroidRecently Zebra introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).LG is available on the [insert product family] and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:---ZEBRA logo1) **Extended Security Service Life** - Security updates under LG is based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) **Timely, Periodic Security Updates** – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) **Security Support Through OS transitions** - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here.---# 7.

LifeGuard for AndroidRecently Zebra introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Mobility DNA Solution).LG is available on the TC53e/TC53e-RFID/TC58e and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:1) **Extended Security Service Life** - Security updates under LG is based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) **Timely, Periodic Security Updates** – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) **Security Support Through OS transitions** - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here.## 7.

LifeGuard for AndroidRecently Zebra introduced LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) representing an Operating System (OS) security support model for select Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Zebra DNA for Mobile Computers).LG is available on the [insert product family] and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:1) Extended Security Service Life - Security updates under LG is based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) Timely, Periodic Security Updates – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) Security Support Through OS transitions - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here---# 7.

LifeGuard for AndroidZebra LifeGuard™ for Android™ (LG) represents an Operating System (OS) security support model for Zebra Android products covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract. (Read about LifeGuard as part of our Zebra DNA Solution).---LifeGuard is available on the EM45 RFID family and for devices covered by a Zebra OneCare active contract, it includes the following support:1) Extended Security Service Life - Security updates under LG is based on the device life cycle. Under LG, security patches are made available for the product hardware service life. For Zebra products that is either 6, 8, or 10 years. This is well beyond the security support provided by Google. Extended security support significantly lowers customer Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by enabling devices to stay in service for a longer period of time.2) Timely, Periodic Security Updates – customers receive security updates as frequently as monthly or quarterly (depending on the platform lifecycle). Having the latest updates on a regular cadence enhances portfolio security while making update logistics more manageable.3) Security Support Through OS transitions - when Zebra releases a new Android OS, quarterly, LifeGuard updates for the older OS continues for a period of 12 months. Referred to as an OS Transition Period (OTP), this maintains the security of the customer portfolio during the transition to a new OS release.For more information about LifeGuard, please click here.## 7.

Frequently Asked QuestionsQ Does the EM45 RFID device include any accessories?A Yes, all the EM45 RFID device SKUs include a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 supported USB-C cable for fast charging.Q Does EM45 RFID have any Zebra DNA software included?A Yes, EM45 RFID will include the Mobility DNA Enterprise license.Q How can the battery in EM45 RFID be replaced?---A EM45 RFID supports a service-replaceable battery. In case of issues with the battery, customers with an active Zebra OneCare contract can send the device to the nearest Zebra Service Center or an Authorized Service Partner to get the battery replaced.Q Does EM45 RFID also support WWAN / Cellular Connectivity?A Yes, EM45 RFID has the industry-first capability to support the built-in RFID short-range reading, along with WWAN / cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity as well as Bluetooth and NFC at the same time. This means that you can get a call or transfer cellular data the same time you are using the RFID.Q Does EM45 RFID support wireless charging?A No, it supports fast charging with USB 3.0. Customer feedback indicated a larger battery and ability to fast charge with USB power delivery is more efficient, sustainable, (relates to carbon footprint) and was preferred over wireless charging.Q Does Zebra's protective case for EM45 RFID increase the drop specification of the device?A Yes, the drop specification is enhanced with the protective case. The drop specification is 5 ft (1.5m) to tile over concrete across temperature (0 to 50 ºC / 32 to 122 ºF) with protective boot exceeding MIL-STD-810H. Without the protective case, it supports multiple drops to 4 ft (1.2m) to tile over concrete across temperature (0 to 50 ºC / 32 to 122 ºF) exceeding MIL-STD 810H.Q It looks like the power button on EM45 RFID includes a fingerprint reader. Will Zebra Identity Guardian support be included as well?A EM45 RFID supports both facial and fingerprint on-device biometrics. It will also support Identity Guardian to only extend facial recognition for enterprise level authentication.Q Will the charge/dock accessories support the device with protective case installed? (i.e. Workstation Connect Cradle). Or will the protective case need to be removed to use in these accessories?A Yes, both the WorkStation Connect and charging cradles are supported with the protective case from Zebra. Charging cradle will be available later in 2025.Q Where is the NFC antenna?A The NFC antenna is located in the back below the camera mesa. The Zebra head logo is the sweet spot to read NFC tags or cards.Q Will there be any specialty apps on the phone for RFID?A EM45 RFID includes the Zebra 123RFID demo app to showcase the built-in RFID reading capability. It also supports the Unified Zebra RFID SDK for Android, that adds a comprehensive set of APIs to easily create powerful applications.The information contained or referenced in this DN/PMB is derived from a variety of sources and may not be accurate, complete, or up to date.

Zebra hingegen investierte bereits 2011 in Android für Unternehmen. Wir sind mit einem Marktanteil von 64 % und 21 Android-Produkten der unangefochtene Marktführer im Android-Bereich für Unternehmen. Honeywell hingegen hat lediglich einen Anteil von 6 % und 12 Android-Produkte vorzuweisen. | | **Nichts Vergleichbares wie Mobility DNA** Während Honeywell kürzlich Mobility Edge bekanntgab, hat Panasonic keinerlei Software-Ökosystem für seine Android-Produkte vorzuweisen. Es hat in anderen Worten keine Antwort auf die Mobility DNA-Suite an Produktivitäts-, Entwickler- und Verwaltungstools. Wenn Sie den FZ-N2/FZ-T1 kaufen, dann kaufen Sie nur ein Produkt – mehr auch nicht. Neben der Hardware gibt es kaum einen Mehrwert. | || **Wenig Software** Nachahmung ist die aufrichtigste Form der Schmeichelei. Honeywell gab gerade Mobility Edge bekannt. Es hat uns gegenüber einen Rückstand von sieben Jahren und einen Investitionsaufwand von 300 Mio. US-Dollar aufzuholen – das sind astronomische Zahlen in Bezug auf Technologielebenszyklen. Es wird Jahre dauern, bis der Stand erreicht sein wird, an dem sich Mobility DNA bereits heute befindet – in der Zwischenzeit werden wir jedoch weitere neue Funktionen und Tools hinzufügen. | | **Weniger Erfahrung mit Android** Zebra ist der unangefochtene Marktführer im Android-Bereich für Unternehmen.

I heard a Global Shutter is better. | It is important to consider the whole system: the total optical, mechanical and electrical systems that will produce a good barcode read. Looking at one parameter is very short-sighted and misleading. But if we must, a rolling shutter offers many performance advantages, such as: • Smaller pixels enabling us to deliver higher resolution images • Noticeably less noise than a global shutter which can create grainy pictures • No shutter leakage: global shutters' "leak" will cause exposure issues in bright conditions || Honeywell uses two fixed focus engines and claims it is more reliable than an autofocus imager because it has zero moving parts. | The autofocus technology in the SE55 has been tested to withstand more than 10 years of use in even the most scan-intensive use cases. |---# SE55: Countering Honeywell's Attack Points (2 of 2)| They say... | We say... || Honeywell FlexRange has a larger near horizontal Field of View (FOV). | A wider field of view can sometimes provide closer near-range scanning and faster decode time because the scanner can start attempting to decode a barcode as soon as it is seen in the field of view. However, those performance gains also depend on lens quality and design.**Even with the larger field of view on the near imager, the Honeywell FlexRange lens design does not provide closer-near range than the SE55.**Zebra's high-quality lens, design and autofocus technology will deliver extremely fast decode times across a broad variety of barcode types, densities, and distances. |ZEBRA CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL USE ONLY---# Zebra Mobility DNA vs. Honeywell Mobility EdgeZEBRA CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL USE ONLY---# An earlier Android commitment – and more expertise| ZEBRA | Honeywell || **Nearly a decade of proactive commitment.**Zebra recognized the potential advantages of Android in the enterprise and committed to Android in 2011.
