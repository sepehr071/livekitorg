# PM3
## SMART BLUETOOTH SCANNER
### Portability at its best
With the light weight of 65g (2.3oz) and small size fitting well in one hand, PM3 is one of the most comfortable scanning devices to carry around. It is built for industries like transport & logistics, warehouse management, and delivery where the workers are expected to change locations often. While you're busy with your tasks perhaps walking around, the reliable Bluetooth connection sends captured data to other smart devices in real time.
### Connecting seamlessly to the variety of popular platforms
PM3 is compatible with products run by Android as well as Windows operating systems, making it easier to introduce a new data capture solution into the existing environment with low extra cost. PM3 lowers the barrier to digitalizing any workflow of warehouse management, inventory taking, or delivery.
### A Powerful scan performance in disguise of the small form factor
PM3 offers three types of scan engines including two 1D and one 1D/2D imager. You might opt for a 1D scan engine if your work environment only uses 1D barcodes. But if your business can benefit from applying QR codes or needs more scanning power and speed in general, a 1D/2D engine can be a better fit which also supports omnidirectional scanning as an added benefit. While you use the scanner or change settings the bright OLED display shows you what's going on.
### A low maintenance device withstanding a harsh environment
PM3 withstands multiple drops from 1.5m (5ft) to the concrete floor at room temperature (MIL STD 810G) and has an IP54 water/dust resistance rating. The physical scan button has gone through 1,000,000 durability test cycles: The PM3 is a device built to last with minimum needs for repair even in a harsh working environment.

Fast, powerful, and rugged: PM75 is cut out for these three ideals, while maintaining a light and ergonomic body. The Android device provides a powerful scan engine, comfortable grip, long lasting battery, and seven long years of update support—all of which are the essential components for building a great and versatile rugged mobile computer.
### Fine tuned hardware for the best operating system
Qualcomm's 2.0 GHz processor runs the device smoothly with the help of 3 GB RAM / 32 GB ROM (opt. 4 GB / 64 GB). PM75 comes with two scan engine options (N3601 or N6603) to match your business needs. The Android 11 operating system offers efficient battery management, easy navigation, and the best data security among any existing mobile operating system. Both the hard parts and software are carefully tuned for each other, enabling PM75 to run the latest powerful solutions effortlessly. EmKit™, Point Mobile's unique set of tools for businesses, is pre installed for easy bulk deployment, management, and increasing productivity.
### Designed for tough handling and low maintenance
The bright 5.5" HD+ (720 x 1440 pixels) display helps users to see and control PM75's interface without difficulty even under the sunlight. The device withstands multiple drops to concrete from 1.5 m (5 ft.) height and has an IP65 water/dust resistance rating, in addition to the protection from scratches by adopting Gorilla Glass: ready to operate in one of the harshest working environments.

# Battlecard PM67
Official Point Mobile Battlecard for PM67
Date: Apr 26, 2021
Last updated on: Mar 15, 2023
Contact: pm_mk@pointmobile.com
## FULL PHYSICAL KEYPAD FOR DASHING SPEED AND ACCURACY
### PM66+1
PM67 is a rugged Android mobile computer with a full numeric keypad that shares its form factor with PM66, the predecessor and inspiration. PM66 has proven its power and versatility around many applications, and we now upgraded the internals and improved performance, while leaving the outside intact.
### Keeping the good things
In many industrial applications, users prefer physical keys instead of a touch based virtual keypad on screen when they need an absolutely accurate data input. The full numeric keypad comes in even more handy when working with gloves or outside in bad weather. Each key on PM67 is wide and big enough for solid and fast typing. LED back lit keypad makes working easy even in dimly lit areas. As well as the keypad, the dimension and the shape of the device remains the same as its predecessor, making PM67 backward compatible with nearly all accessories of PM66 and keeping the cost per device on a low.
| PM66 | |
|                                                                                    |   |
| • Android 6 • 1.2GHz Quad core • 2GB/16GB Memory • Micro USB Type B • Standard SIM | |
| PM67 | |
| • Android 11 • 2.0GHz Octa core • 3GB/32GB Memory • USB Type C • Micro SIM | |
### More power for advanced solutions
Despite the same external design, almost all performance aspects have gone through an upgrade. PM67 runs Android 11 OS, offering better security and more convenient yet intuitive interface. 2.0GHz Qualcomm Octa core processor (1.8GHz optional) and 3GB RAM run even power intensive business solutions smoothly. Bluetooth 5.1 with BLE support helps PM67 connect to multiple devices instantly and reliably, and Wi Fi data transfer is about three times faster than PM66 (maximum speed comparison). LTE model is still optionally available.

▲ Backward compatibility
By keeping the form factor for which PM66
has been praised, we made almost all the
existing PM66's accessories compatible with
PM67, including Single Slot Cradle, 4 Slot
Cradle, Battery Charger, Gun Handle, etc. USB

# Digital Health Care Solutions
PM30hc Mobile Computer   made for the convenience and safety of healthcare providers.
   
# 01 RELY ON STABLE COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR STAFF   VIA LTE OR WIFI
When a patient's life is at stake, direct and error free communication is a crucial factor. With integrated LTE and Wi Fi technology, PM30hc stays connected when you need it. Update patient records, track lab results, and discuss the next steps of treatment with your staff.
Breaks in connection can prove hugely costly and cause serious consequences. To avoid disruptions, PM30hc's Qualcomm® chipset contains a powerful Wi Fi module, supporting both 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies. Additionally, thanks to Wi Fi roaming, you can move freely within your premises, while PM30hc automatically connects to the nearest access point with the strongest signal. It prevents users from having to re log back into a network with the same SSID when it associates with a new access point. It is possible to specifically set the values for roaming aggressiveness based on the network environment where PM30hc is being used.
A dedicated Push to talk (PTT) button lets you reach out to a single person or even a group of people at an instant. It works similar to a walkie talkie: One person transmits, the others receive. This adds a significant advantage when handling time critical information.
[Wi Fi ALLIANCE logo]
   
# 02
722,000 infections are contracted every year in US hospitals   good hygiene helps against the spread of germs and reduces the risk of infections.
Mobile computers used in the medical field need to be protected against sanitizers. PM30hc's housing is made of a special material and is resistant to alcohol & ethanol.
According to CDC, healthcare providers clean their hands as many as 100 times during a 12 hour shift. Aiming to reduce the risk of infections for both patients and staff, good hand hygiene is extremely important. But also equipment and electronic devices used in the hospital environment are covered in germs which can cause serious infections. Cleaning those devices often result in deterioration, since materials are not designed to be exposed to the heavy usage of sanitizers. That's why healthcare facilities trust PM30hc: Its corrosion resistant housing is resistant to various types of disinfectant, including chlorine or 70% alcohol solutions.
¹According to CDC's Clean Hands Count Campaign
   
# 03
## EXCEPTIONAL COMPUTING POWER
Despite its small form factor, PM30hc comes with the latest Android™ 10 version, and the possibility to upgrade to newer versions. An incredibly fast clock speed of 2.2GHz and 4GB RAM / 64GB ROM run all of your apps seamlessly. The PTT button on the side of the device lets you communicate with your staff instantly. Of course, PM30hc can also be used for phone calls via the high speed 4G LTE modem. Storage is extendable with SD card.
## WIRELESS CHARGING
PM30hc can be charged wirelessly with compatible chargers (sold separately). When charging by USB C, Qualcomm® Quick Charge 3.0™ boosts PM30hc's battery level to over 50% in less than an hour.
![Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 logo]
## OPTICAL FINGERPRINT READER AND POGO PIN
When confidential patient data and lab results have to be protected, PM30hc's integrated optical fingerprint reader on the back of the housing adds a layer of security via user identification. Below the fingerprint reader is a pogo pin connector for additional accessory, such as a UHF reader extension or a gun handle.
   
# INTEGRATED BARCODE SCANNER
Utilizing barcode technology in the health care industry brings many advantages: Ensuring patient safety, reduced risk of false medication, improved efficiency for inventory tasks, and many more   from admission to discharge of a patient.
On a daily basis, healthcare facilities deal with patient admission, tracking assets and inventory, and validating information. In an environment where every second matters, practitioners rely on the right data at the right time. Using barcode technology helps to organize all processes around the patient: Once admitted, the patient receives a wristband with a barcode, containing all relevant information for doctors and nurses. That barcode is linked to the patient's Electronic Health Record, or EHR, which is constantly updated when a treatment is ordered or medication is changed.
## 04
Typically, barcode enabled devices come in a much larger form factor when integrated into a mobile computer. If a smaller, more compact device is required, often times a separate barcode scanner will be used in addition to a smartphone. PM30hc combines both worlds: It is a compact, light weight rugged mobile computer (165g, 5.8oz) with an integrated super slim 2D barcode imager engine from Honeywell.

### Easy pair to use the full power of mobile computers
Equipped with power efficient Bluetooth v4.2 supporting BLE, the PM5 can operate up to 8h with standard 510mAh battery. Optional extended battery with 700mAh pushes the uptime further to 11h. This also allows fast and no delay data transfer to Point Mobile's rugged computing devices. All you have to do for paring is just one tap – and enjoy the lightweight and convenience of a ring scanner while using all the computing power and the enterprise mobility solutions that Point Mobile offers.
### Don't stop moving just to scan a barcode
Inside of PM5 lies an ultra slim 2D imager which can tolerate motion speed of up to 6.0 m/s, easily capturing fast moving objects with accuracy. You can also scan while moving your hands, making no interruption on your workflow. The scan engine has one of the lowest power demands in its class, increasing the battery life of the PM5 even further.
### Rugged for any industrial applications
The PM5 is a rugged scanner designed to withstand harsh working environments. It can survive multiple drops to concrete from 1.8m/6 ft. over the operating temperature range and is equipped with IP65 grade water/dust resistance. You can operate the device in temperatures from 0°C to 50°C. And the loud 85 dBA buzzer will make sure you'll notice when you've successfully scanned   even in noisy work environments. PM5 comes with programmable LEDs for perfect integration and customization.
